# OscCtcSound

This a work in progress. Using PySimpleGUI, ctcsound and Csound. A SQLite database contains Csound code and corresponding GUI code.
The template is meant to be a structure with maybe one preloaded instrument and effects. It should be possible to load other instruments and effects after the initial loading of the template.
This initial example shows some sliders controlling the template and a simple VU meter...
